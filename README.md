## Getting Started
This project is a web-based game. The game is developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript technologies. In this game, rabbit will collect carrots in the forest to feed itself. As it collects carrots, many turtles appear in front of it. These turtles want to steal the carrots in the rabbit's hand by coming in front of the rabbit as obstacles. The rabbit must escape by jumping over these obstacles. It should also try to collect carrots that come across on the way. In addition, the speed of the game increases over time and therefore the game gets harder.

## The Goal of The Game
The goal is to collect the most carrots by escaping from the turtles.
